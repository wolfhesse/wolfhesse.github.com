=== Subsection one

You can even do subsections of each chapter.

==== Sub-sub section

And sub-sub-sections of each chapter.

You can also do tips and warning boxes and such like this:

TIP: Tip.

IMPORTANT: This is important.

WARNING: This is a warning.

CAUTION: Tread lightly.

If you need to embed source code, you can do so from external files
like this:

[c]
source~~~~
include::include/hello.c[]
source~~~~

=== Source Code Highlighting

Or you can put the code directly in the file, like this.

[source,python]
if n < 0: print 'Hello World!'

=== Splitting up the book

Now, if you prefer to write so that each chapter is in a seperate file,
which is probably a good idea, you can instead have each chapter as 
another file and then simply add include lines in this file.  Here is
what including another chapter looks like:

include::chapter2.asc[]
include::categories.asc[]
include::privacy-chapter.asc[]
