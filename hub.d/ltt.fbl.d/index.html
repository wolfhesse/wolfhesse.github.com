## collapse of the first global civilization

### update



### Index To Written Parts Of The Series

This series addresses the current environmental crisis in light of major new discoveries about human culture: the [A3 Discoveries](http://www.a3society.org/Principles). You can find the other parts which have been written as follows:

[Part 1](https://medium.com/@B_Nappi/collapse-of-the-first-global-civilization-e017a1e30eb1) , The A3 Discoveries, introduced the two major reasons the First Global Civilization has started into collapse: over population vs. limited resources, and complexity vs. limited human brain ability. The A3 discoveries were also introduced. They will be used throughout the series to explain in more detail why these two problems are causing the collapse and how society can best get through it. This part also explained how the world, until just after WWII, still lacked an adequate scientific understanding to see how human civilization was approaching a limit to sustain human life.

[Part 2](https://medium.com/@B_Nappi/collapse-of-the-first-global-civilization-part-2-b2a5104b1652) , Population and Resource Limits, discussed how the scientific studies finally started coming together in the late ’50s to expose the impending problem. The studies quantified how our current world population is using resources faster than the earth can replenish them. The studies showed that the “storeroom” of critical supplies nature created before humans arrived is running out. Humans, however, were not able to accept the new scientific observations.

Part 2 then briefly explains why the new science alone was not sufficient to successfully change human behavior. Even though people throughout the world see evidence right in from of them, because of limitation of human thinking, most humans aren’t able to understand the science or VISUALIZE the implications. There are some people who did understand it and tried to explain to the world the impending ecological crises we face.

In 1962, Rachael Carson write the book Silent Spring about the world wide death of birds due to DDT. Large public protests occurred. It still took over 10 years of protests, the establishment of the Environmental Defense Fund, and many expensive lawsuits for the US to respond with a national ban on DDT. A similar process occurred after the publication of Farman’s 1985 report on the Ozone Hole. But, the phase-out of Freon only started in ’94 with a “directive” from the UN, with further enforcement by the EU in ’97. However, this problem has still not been put to bed! Only as recently as 2007, at the Montreal climate summit, did most of the countries in the world agree to stop fluorocarbon use. But even then, the complete ban date was kicked down the road to 2020!

For the last 40 years, world governments, university professors, leaders in the environmental movement and many media celebrities have talked about the problem. But they have made very little progress. Society, however, has made major breakthroughs before, like putting a man on the moon. So, why have these 40 years of talk been so unsuccessful?

[Part 3](https://medium.com/@B_Nappi/collapse-of-the-first-global-civilization-part-3-e5fc8d7b9c1a) , Complexity and Stone Age Brains, explained the concept of the “Stone Age brain” and how the limits of current human brains are not capable of dealing with the complexity of modern technology or the complex social structures we have set up. Human brains are fine tuned for quick responses to dangers immediately at hand. If your house catches fire, and you see the flames, your brain will instantly think of many ways to get out. When the problem is very complex, and the details can’t be directly observed, human brains don’t do so well.

[Part 4](https://medium.com/@B_Nappi/collapse-of-the-first-global-civilization-part-4-df93907934e5#.caf6mzc32) , The A3 Brain, Human Consciousness and the Crisis of Psychology, went beyond the simple inability of human brains to understand complexity and discussed deep psychological barriers Stone Age brains have that block people from taking action.

[Part 5](https://medium.com/@B_Nappi/collapse-of-the-first-global-civilization-part-5-18565bcca1e6#.3un3miq73) , Language, Government Gridlock and the Breakdown of Communication, dug into a never before understood problem of human language that has gridlocked governments around the world and prevented humans, the media, academia and public spokes people from being able to understand each other.

[Part 6](https://medium.com/@B_Nappi/collapse-of-the-first-global-civilization-part-6-790293e41e5e#.4yn23lqr8), The Failure of Democracy, digs into the major flaws pervading one of modern society’s most fundamental and cherished institutions: DEMOCRACY! These include: the conflict of government and freedom, majority rule, Lynch Mob Democracy and human rights, the lies of governments, and Direct Democracy.

Additional parts will be added to this list as they are written. Check back [here](https://medium.com/@B_Nappi/collapse-of-the-first-global-civilization-e017a1e30eb1)for updates.
